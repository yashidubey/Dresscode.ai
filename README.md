About

Dresscode.ai is a deep learning-based system that generates 3D garment patterns and realistic textures from natural language prompts. It combines a GPT-style model (SewingGPT) for sewing pattern token generation and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for producing high-quality, tileable PBR textures. The system enables end-to-end virtual clothing design, offering outputs compatible with 3D rendering and simulation tools like Blender.

Features

Natural Language Input: Describe the garment you want (e.g., “sleeveless midi dress with floral pattern”), and get both 3D patterns and textures.

Token-Based Pattern Synthesis: SewingGPT produces structured pattern sequences refined from training datasets.

High-Quality Tileable Textures: Stable Diffusion ensures consistency and realism in patterns.

Gradio UI Support: Interactive interface for prompt-based generation and optional texture editing.

Exportable Outputs: Generate standard OBJ/GLTF meshes with texture files.

(Optional) Simulation Support: Full pipeline with Blender/Maya rendering integration for visualization and animation.
