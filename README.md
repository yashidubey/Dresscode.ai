Dresscode.ai is a deep learning-based system that generates 3D garment patterns and realistic textures from natural language prompts. It combines a GPT-style model (SewingGPT) for sewing pattern token generation and a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for producing high-quality, tileable PBR textures. The system enables end-to-end virtual clothing design, offering outputs compatible with 3D rendering and simulation tools like Blender.
